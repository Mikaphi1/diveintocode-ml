    "a regular burger bun is roughly 3 and a half inches in diameter. This translates to 0.0889 meters. The radius is, therefore, is 0.04445 meters (or 4.5cm). a regular bun is also 2 inches in height and this translates to 0.0508 metres (or 5cm).\n",

    "Here, it is assumed that pluto is at the edge of the solar system and is the farthest orbiting object. It must be noted that pluto is no longer considered a planet. The farthest planet from the sun is Neptune. however, for the this exercise, the orbit of Pluto shall be considered as the farthest edge of the solar system. The distance of Pluto from the sun is 5.9 billion kilometeres (or 39.5 astronomical units(AU)) from the sun. This can be taken as the radius of the system. in meters, this can be expressed as 5.9 * 10^12\n",
